<h2 id="procedural-programming">Procedural programming</h2>
<p>In procedural programming, a program is divided into smaller parts called methods. These methods are the basic entities used to construct a program. One of the main advantages of procedural programming is code reusability. However, the implementation of a complex real-world scenario becomes a difficult and unwieldy task.</p>
<h2 id="object-oriented-programming">Object-oriented programming</h2>
<p>Object-oriented programming, also referred to as OOP, is a programming paradigm that includes, or relies, on the concept of classes and objects.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-objects-and-classes">Anatomy of objects and classes</h2>
<p>Objects are a collection of data and their behaviors.   <br>
A class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects.</p>
<h2 id="user-defined-data-types">User-defined data types</h2>
<p>While primitive data types only focus on modeling the state of the object, user-defined data types can encapsulate the state and its behaviors into a unit.</p>
<p><img src="../pic/user_defined.png" alt="user_defined"></p>
<h1 id="class-and-objects">Class and Objects</h1>
<p>A class has a singular blueprint, and objects are part of a class and are differentiated by their distinct properties.</p>
<p>An employee has the following properties or attributes:</p>
<p><strong>ID</strong>    <br>
<strong>Salary</strong>    <br>
<strong>Department</strong>   <br>
The following actions or behaviors can beperformed on an employee:</p>
<p><strong>Calculation of tax on salary</strong>  <br>
<strong>Calculation of salary per day</strong></p>
<h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>
<p>Properties are variables that contain information regarding the object of a class. An employee object will have an ID, a salary, and the department as its properties.</p>
<p>*(Attributes are also referred to as properties or members. For consistency, we will be using properties throughout the course.)</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>Methods are like functions that have access to properties (and other methods) of a class. Methods can accept parameters and return values. They are used to perform an action on an object of a class. In the example above, we have tax() and salaryPerDay() as class methods/(menmber functions).</p>
<h2 id="declare-a-class">Declare a Class</h2>
<pre><code>class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()  # creating a MyClass Object
print(obj)
</code></pre><h2 id="implement-properties-in-a-class">Implement properties in a class</h2>
<p><strong>Note that you do not initialize the values of properties, the Python code will not compile. Initializing the values of properties inside the class is necessary.</strong></p>
<pre><code># this code will compile
class Employee:
    # defining the properties and assigning them none
    ID = None
    salary = None
    department = None

# this code will give a compilation error
class Employee: 
    # defining the properties and not assigning them none
    ID
    salary
    department
</code></pre><h3 id="access-properties-and-assign-values">Access properties and assign values</h3>
<h4 id="creating-properties-outside-a-class">Creating properties outside a class</h4>
<pre><code>object.property

class Employee:
    # defining the properties and assigning them None
    ID = None
    salary = None
    department = None


# cerating an object of the Employee class
Steve = Employee()

# assigning values to properties of Steve - an object of the Employee class
Steve.ID = 3789
Steve.salary = 2500
Steve.department = &quot;Human Resources&quot;

# creating a new attribute for Steve
Steve.title = &quot;Manager&quot;

# Printing properties of Steve
print(&quot;ID =&quot;, Steve.ID)
print(&quot;Salary&quot;, Steve.salary)
print(&quot;Department:&quot;, Steve.department)
print(&quot;Title:&quot;, Steve.title)
</code></pre><h3 id="initializer">Initializer</h3>
<p>The initialization method is similar to other methods but has a pre-defined name, <strong>init</strong>.</p>
<p>The initializer is used to initialize an object of a class. The initializer is a special method because it does not have a return type. The first parameter of <strong>init</strong> is self, which is a way to refer to the object being initialized.</p>
<pre><code>class Employee:
    # defining the properties and assigning them None
    def __init__(self, ID, salary, department):
        self.ID = ID
        self.salary = salary
        self.department = department


# creating an object of the Employee class with default parameters
Steve = Employee(3789, 2500, &quot;Human Resources&quot;)

# Printing properties of Steve
print(&quot;ID :&quot;, Steve.ID)
print(&quot;Salary :&quot;, Steve.salary)
print(&quot;Department :&quot;, Steve.department)
</code></pre><p><strong>(It is important to define the initializer with complete parameters to avoid any errors. Similar to methods, initializers also have the provision for optional parameters.)</strong></p>
